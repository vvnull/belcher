Belcher
=======

This is an exercise in artificial intelligence, as applied to **Magic: The Gathering**. This program plays Goblin Charbelcher.

Originally a school project written in Java, it was then ported to Common Lisp, and is now encased in a C++ wrapper that will more easily allow for adding visual card-parsing functionality.

How to run
----------
    make
    ./belcher
